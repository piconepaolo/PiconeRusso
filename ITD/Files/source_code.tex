The folder of the source code includes two folders and installation scripts. The folders are:
\begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{app}: contains the source code of the application.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item \textbf{api}: contains the source code of the endpoints and the dependencies used by the apis.
            \item \textbf{core}: contains the application configuration file as well as security settings.
            \item \textbf{crud}: contains the source code of the crud operations for the main entities of the application.
            \item \textbf{EvaluationManager}: contains the source code of the evaluation manager.
            \item \textbf{schemas}: contains the source code of the Pydantic schemas used both by apis and crud operations.
            \item \textbf{github}: it's a module that provides methods to interact with the GitHub API.
            \item \textbf{utils}: it's a general purpose module that provides some useful methods to the application like singleton to implement the singleton pattern and mongo utilities to embed the Pydantic models in nested MongoDB documents.
        \end{itemize}
        \item \textbf{tests}: contains the source code of the tests. The concern of the tests is easily understandable by the name of the files which contains the entities that are tested.
\end{itemize}
