Since the applicaton is dockerized the installation process is very simple. \\
In order to not expose sensible data the app has to read an environment file in which there are the sensible and configuration data. The file is called \textit{app.env} and it should be placed in the root of the project. The file can be downloaded from the following \href{https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KUKvAb3Tq8bOUhCrtx5sqfwQsWZShJam/view?usp=sharing}{Google Drive link} \\
Once downloaded the \textit{app.env} file, the installation process is the following:
\begin{itemize}
        \item Clone the repository from the following \href{https://github.com/piconepaolo/PiconeRusso/tree/main/ITD/Code}{GitHub Repository}
        \item Place the \textit{app.env} file in the root of the source code \textit{Code}
        \item Build the docker images by running the command \textit{docker-compose build}
        \item Run the docker images by running the command \textit{docker-compose up}
        \item The application is now running and it is possible to access it at the following address: \textit{http://localhost:8080}
\end{itemize}
