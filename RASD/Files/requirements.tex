\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Since there is no particular hardware requirement for the system, the system will be able to run on any hardware that can run a web browser and has an internet connection.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The system will utilize the GitHub API to streamline its operations. It will be used to create repository by CKB Platform and to trigger real-time evaluations of submissions. This approach ensures efficient management and transparent, interactive engagement for participants directly within their GitHub environment.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The system provides the functionality of automatic evaluation. This function requires the system to communicate with an external client that triggers this automatic actions. In particular, the system needs to expose an API that the GitHub Action set up by the students will call when a new commit is pushed.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
This section specifies all the requirements that the system must satisfy in order to be considered complete and functional.

\subsection{Performance Requirements}
Since the system needs to perform the automatic evaluation of the submission of the teams, the system should be at least able to perform concurrent evaluations of the submissions equal to the number of teams in the battle in order to avoid misleading scores for the consolidation stage.

\subsection{Design Constraints}
\subsubsection{Standards compliance}
About privacy and security, the system should comply with the GDPR regulation and the OWASP security standards.
The system should adopt standards regarding the rapresentation of date and time, in order to avoid confusion between different formats.
\subsubsection{Hardware limitations}
The platform should be able to run on any device with a browser and an internet connection and should not require any specific hardware.
\subsubsection{Any other constraint}
Since the platform is a web application, it should be compatbile with any screen size and should be responsive. Moreover the platform should be easy to use and intuitive.
