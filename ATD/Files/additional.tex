The overall installation process was very tedious and cumbersome. The architecture is composed by several technologies that need a proper configuration in order to communicate with each other. The configuration process is very prone to human errors and not easily replicable. An easier and more user-friendly installation process would be using a \textit{Docker} container. \\
Moreover, the documentation section (\textit{Section 6.8}) related to the run of the application refers to an executable (\textit{runCKB.bat}) compatible only with \textit{Windows System}. This script was a limitation since the group that was redacting the ATD document was provided with only \textit{Mac OS} machines. The problem was easily overcome by converting the script into a \textit{.sh} file, compatible with \textit{Unix Like Systems}.
