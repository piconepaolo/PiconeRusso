The platform aims to create a competitive environment where teams of students can participate in programming tournaments and solve programming challenges.

By offering a platform specifically designed for programming practice, CodeKataBattle aims to provide students with a structured and engaging way to improve their coding abilities. The competitive nature of the platform adds an extra layer of motivation and excitement, encouraging students to push their limits and strive for excellence.

Overall, the motivations behind the existence of the CodeKataBattle platform are to create a dedicated space for programming practice, foster healthy competition among students, and provide a means for tracking and improving programming skills.

\subsubsection{Goals}
[G1] Educator can create a tournament
[G2] Educator can create battles for the tournament
[G3] Student can compete in a tournament
[G4] Team of students can compete in a battle
[G5] Student is evaluated based on the performance in the battle
[G6] Student are notified about upcoming tournaments

\subsection{Scope}
The scope of this project is to develop a platform (CodeKataBattle) that is intended to be used by students for practicing their programming skills.
The platform is used in a competitive setting where teams of students compete against each other in tournaments where they are given programming problems to solve.
The platform is equipped with a ranking system that ranks that assigns...
Additionally, the platform incorporates a ranking system that assigns scores to participants based on their performance in the tournaments. This ranking system not only adds a competitive element but also allows students to track their progress and compare their skills with others. This can be a valuable tool for self-assessment and identifying areas for improvement.
