\subsubsection{Hardware Interfaces}
Since there is no particular hardware requirement for the system, the system will be able to run on any hardware that can run a web browser and has an internet connection.

\subsubsection{Software Interfaces}
The system in order to perform its functions does not require any interaction with other software systems.

\subsubsection{Communication Interfaces}
The system provides the functionality of automatic evaluation. This function requires the system to communicate with an external client that triggers this automatic actions. In particular, the system needs to expose an API that the GitHub Action set up by the students will call when a new commit is pushed.

\subsection{Functional Requirements}
This section specifies all the requirements that the system must satisfy in order to be considered complete and functional.
